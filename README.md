 JS Form Validation - submission by Masayo Williams

This is a submission for MTM1526 - Client-Side Development, an assignment using JS as the scripting language.

## Description
JavaScript is used for form handling, and the CSS styles as specified in the assignment information.  The page design is written in HTML5.

## Use
The form is designed with 4 input fields; Full Name, Email, Message, and Submit.
The form validates and collects data from each input field, although the data does not go anywhere yet.

Whan a user enters the data in each field and clicks on submit button, the form clears all input fields, and a feedback text is output below the form in green.
If any field is missing entry, or email validation against regex is failed, upon submission, a text is output describing each error in red.

## Future Improvements
The data stored in JS object will be passed to the server-side and stored in a database for use at a later time...
